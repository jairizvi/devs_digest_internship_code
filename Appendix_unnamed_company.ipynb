      "<p>Hey guys, I just wanted to share my story, because I know there are others who are in the same boat that I was in just 12 months prior. Maybe I can provide comfort, wisdom, or both <img src=\"https://talk-cdn.collegeconfidential.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n",
      "<p>I’m an international student. I don’t know what you guys might know, but international students have extremely harder time being accepted into the top U.S. colleges. That makes sense. U.S. colleges should prioritize educating U.S. citizens first. I get that. Furthermore international students have hard time affording U.S. and Canadian colleges. The North American institutions for higher education are unreasonably expensive and most do not provide financial aid/scholarships to international students or provide very small amount of financial aid/scholarships. Furthermore for me, coming from an international country that cultivates a crop of great applicants every year (South Korea! Whoop whoop!), I knew it would be a challenge for me to be accepted into the top colleges even if I had a great resume.</p>\n",
      "<p>I applied to the top colleges (Ivy League schools, Northwestern, McGill, UBC, etc…) and I thought I had good to great chances to be accepted into some of those schools. I had 2300+ SAT I scores, perfect SAT II scores, 5’s on my multiple AP tests, a great admission essay, and a spectacular list of extracurricular activities ranging from Model United Nations to basketball to flute club. I also have an interesting background of having lived in three countries including the States which I thought would be a huge plus.</p>\n",
      "<p>I only applied to those mostly private top schools and not public top schools like UVa or UCB not because I thought the public schools weren’t as good, but because I knew that I had absolutely no chance of affording a public school. Money is tight in my family. I really wanted to go back to the States for college so I was praying that my stats were good enough for the top colleges that I applied to and enough financial aid/scholarships would be provided for me.</p>\n",
      "<p>I remember Ivy Day like it was yesterday. Since I was living in Asia, I woke up super early on Ivy Day to check my results. To be honest, I couldn’t sleep the night before. I tossed and turned all night with butterflies in my stomach.</p>\n",
      "<p>I logged on the computer and I opened my email. I checked the most “unlikely” schools first. Open Harvard’s email. “I’m sorry to tell you we are unable to offer you a spot…”.<br>\n",
      "Open Yale’s system. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Dartmouth’s system. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Columbia. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Brown. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Cornell. Same thing<br>\n",
      "Open Northwestern. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open WUSTL. Accepted. Yes! Check scholarship. 5000 USD for 60,000 USD cost.</p>\n",
      "<p>I hope you don’t have to go through the same thing I went through that day. To open those emails one by one, anticipating with fingers crossed to see the words, “Congratulations!”, only to see those words… it was heart-breaking to say the least. I hope I never see the words “I’m sorry” again in my life.</p>\n",
      "<p>I got into McGill and UBC as well, but those were also unaffordable.</p>\n",
      "<p>Needless to say, I went into a deep depression the last couple of months of senior year. All I did was sleep, my appetite was horrible, and I shunned friends that I wouldn’t be able to see after graduation.</p>\n",
      "<p>I cursed my situation. Why wasn’t my family rich like other international students so that I could at least go to public school? What was wrong with my application and interviews? Would the story have been different if I was born in the States and was treated as a domestic student? What didn’t I do enough? I bet it was me not doing flute club for one more year that made the difference. What was wrong with my application? What was wrong with my essay? What was wrong with me?</p>\n",
      "<p>About two weeks after Ivy Day, I received an acceptance offer from one of the top universities in Hong Kong.</p>\n",
      "<p>I thought… Hong Kong? That’s China and China is in Asia. I don’t want to go to university in Asia. I want to go to an American college. I should have been happy with the acceptance, but in my depression I didn’t care about the acceptance. I treated the offer like it was handed out to everyone.</p>\n",
      "<p>The summer passed and with no other options I boarded a flight to Hong Kong to begin my studies.</p>\n",
      "<p>I boarded the flight back in late August, but it might as well have happened in my previous life seeing as I have been completely transformed after attending my university.</p>\n",
      "<p>After arriving at my university, I met so many intelligent and talented people. People here were geniuses! They were also talented in so many things like dancing, sports, debate, and more.</p>\n",
      "<p>I also saw the acceptance rate for my university the year I applied and it was less than 10% for internationals.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even if I didn’t see that acceptance rate, I would have still known I was lucky to be at my university.<br>\n",
      "Sure I don’t get to go to crazy frat parties or cheer on my team at a thunderous football game, I still knew I was very lucky and blessed to be at my university.</p>\n",
      "<p>I came to Hong Kong depressed and angry, but in about a week when I board my flight back to my home for the winter, I will leave feeling blessed and happy.</p>\n",
      "<p>I guess what I’m trying to tell you guys, you international students who are in the same boat as I was in last year is that there is such a big world out there. You international students who have excellent grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities, but fail to get into the U.S. colleges, just know that there are excellent universities elsewhere that you will come to love over time. I know it might sound impossible, but trust me. And if you guys are really talented, it shouldn’t matter where you guys go for college; you guys will grow academically and personally wherever you guys go and will become leaders in whatever fields you guys pursue. Also, American college culture and traditions like football and fraternities are really fun, but other places can be really fun too! Here in Hong Kong, I do dragon boating, indulge myself in dim sum, and celebrate in countless Chinese celebrations!</p>\n",
      "<p>Guys don’t take the rejections personally. I took it too personally and that led me to depression. Rejection doesn’t mean someone who was accepted is a better student or person than you are. College admissions are really random and rely on so many factors that it is unpredictable. Even if you are accepted, don’t celebrate or gloat. Treat the acceptance as a sign that you should work harder and challenge yourself even more. Where ever you guys go, I know you guys will come out shining if you guys keep working as hard as you guys did in high school. And there’s always graduate school if you do really want to go to the States right?</p>\n",
      "<p>I hope the best for all of you guys and I’m praying for you guys even though I don’t know you guys personally. I pray for the best, but expect the worst. I pray that even if the worst happens, you guys will laugh it off and come out as a better person and don’t give up.</p>\n",
      "<p>Good luck and Merry (early) Christmas everybody! <img src=\"https://talk-cdn.collegeconfidential.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n",

      "<p>Hey fellow Hong Kong-er here!

      "<p>Also, just a note for people who are thinking “ooh Hong Kong? Where’s that? Should I apply there?”, OP is right HK universities are pretty damn good. HKU medicine / law students (but of course not just them, there are tons of other great courses and students there as well) are some of the most brilliant students I know.

      "<p>Hi! As an international student that already passed though the stressful college application process, I want to say a couple of things. The OP made a HUGE mistake, or was misinformed, and thus applied to extremely selective college with international acceptance rates of lower than 10%. For other over achieving internationals, there are many other options, such as applying to lower ranked schools that offer both merit and need based aid. This is what students from my school, including me, do. I know many students who have gotten full rides at lower ranked schools, such as St Marys in Texas or Mercyhurst, with SATs around 1600-1800 but with good GPAs. A good student with a 2000+ SAT score is ALMOST guaranteed a scholarship at schools with around 1600-1800 average SAT scores. Also, to anyone wondering, there are only SIX need blind schools for internationals that DO NOT take into consideration your financial situation- Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, Amherst College, MIT. Any over achiever should apply to these schools, but also remembering that the acceptance rate for internationals is less than US citizens due to quotas.</p>\n",

      "<p>Hey guys, I just wanted to share my story, because I know there are others who are in the same boat that I was in just 12 months prior. Maybe I can provide comfort, wisdom, or both <img src=\"https://talk-cdn.collegeconfidential.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n",
      "<p>I’m an international student. I don’t know what you guys might know, but international students have extremely harder time being accepted into the top U.S. colleges. That makes sense. U.S. colleges should prioritize educating U.S. citizens first. I get that. Furthermore international students have hard time affording U.S. and Canadian colleges. The North American institutions for higher education are unreasonably expensive and most do not provide financial aid/scholarships to international students or provide very small amount of financial aid/scholarships. Furthermore for me, coming from an international country that cultivates a crop of great applicants every year (South Korea! Whoop whoop!), I knew it would be a challenge for me to be accepted into the top colleges even if I had a great resume.</p>\n",
      "<p>I applied to the top colleges (Ivy League schools, Northwestern, McGill, UBC, etc…) and I thought I had good to great chances to be accepted into some of those schools. I had 2300+ SAT I scores, perfect SAT II scores, 5’s on my multiple AP tests, a great admission essay, and a spectacular list of extracurricular activities ranging from Model United Nations to basketball to flute club. I also have an interesting background of having lived in three countries including the States which I thought would be a huge plus.</p>\n",
      "<p>I only applied to those mostly private top schools and not public top schools like UVa or UCB not because I thought the public schools weren’t as good, but because I knew that I had absolutely no chance of affording a public school. Money is tight in my family. I really wanted to go back to the States for college so I was praying that my stats were good enough for the top colleges that I applied to and enough financial aid/scholarships would be provided for me.</p>\n",
      "<p>I remember Ivy Day like it was yesterday. Since I was living in Asia, I woke up super early on Ivy Day to check my results. To be honest, I couldn’t sleep the night before. I tossed and turned all night with butterflies in my stomach.</p>\n",
      "<p>I logged on the computer and I opened my email. I checked the most “unlikely” schools first. Open Harvard’s email. “I’m sorry to tell you we are unable to offer you a spot…”.<br>\n",
      "Open Yale’s system. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Dartmouth’s system. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Columbia. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Brown. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open Cornell. Same thing<br>\n",
      "Open Northwestern. Same thing.<br>\n",
      "Open WUSTL. Accepted. Yes! Check scholarship. 5000 USD for 60,000 USD cost.</p>\n",
      "<p>I hope you don’t have to go through the same thing I went through that day. To open those emails one by one, anticipating with fingers crossed to see the words, “Congratulations!”, only to see those words… it was heart-breaking to say the least. I hope I never see the words “I’m sorry” again in my life.</p>\n",
      "<p>I got into McGill and UBC as well, but those were also unaffordable.</p>\n",
      "<p>Needless to say, I went into a deep depression the last couple of months of senior year. All I did was sleep, my appetite was horrible, and I shunned friends that I wouldn’t be able to see after graduation.</p>\n",
      "<p>I cursed my situation. Why wasn’t my family rich like other international students so that I could at least go to public school? What was wrong with my application and interviews? Would the story have been different if I was born in the States and was treated as a domestic student? What didn’t I do enough? I bet it was me not doing flute club for one more year that made the difference. What was wrong with my application? What was wrong with my essay? What was wrong with me?</p>\n",
      "<p>About two weeks after Ivy Day, I received an acceptance offer from one of the top universities in Hong Kong.</p>\n",
      "<p>I thought… Hong Kong? That’s China and China is in Asia. I don’t want to go to university in Asia. I want to go to an American college. I should have been happy with the acceptance, but in my depression I didn’t care about the acceptance. I treated the offer like it was handed out to everyone.</p>\n",
      "<p>The summer passed and with no other options I boarded a flight to Hong Kong to begin my studies.</p>\n",
      "<p>I boarded the flight back in late August, but it might as well have happened in my previous life seeing as I have been completely transformed after attending my university.</p>\n",
      "<p>After arriving at my university, I met so many intelligent and talented people. People here were geniuses! They were also talented in so many things like dancing, sports, debate, and more.</p>\n",
      "<p>I also saw the acceptance rate for my university the year I applied and it was less than 10% for internationals.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even if I didn’t see that acceptance rate, I would have still known I was lucky to be at my university.<br>\n",
      "Sure I don’t get to go to crazy frat parties or cheer on my team at a thunderous football game, I still knew I was very lucky and blessed to be at my university.</p>\n",
      "<p>I came to Hong Kong depressed and angry, but in about a week when I board my flight back to my home for the winter, I will leave feeling blessed and happy.</p>\n",
      "<p>I guess what I’m trying to tell you guys, you international students who are in the same boat as I was in last year is that there is such a big world out there. You international students who have excellent grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities, but fail to get into the U.S. colleges, just know that there are excellent universities elsewhere that you will come to love over time. I know it might sound impossible, but trust me. And if you guys are really talented, it shouldn’t matter where you guys go for college; you guys will grow academically and personally wherever you guys go and will become leaders in whatever fields you guys pursue. Also, American college culture and traditions like football and fraternities are really fun, but other places can be really fun too! Here in Hong Kong, I do dragon boating, indulge myself in dim sum, and celebrate in countless Chinese celebrations!</p>\n",
      "<p>Guys don’t take the rejections personally. I took it too personally and that led me to depression. Rejection doesn’t mean someone who was accepted is a better student or person than you are. College admissions are really random and rely on so many factors that it is unpredictable. Even if you are accepted, don’t celebrate or gloat. Treat the acceptance as a sign that you should work harder and challenge yourself even more. Where ever you guys go, I know you guys will come out shining if you guys keep working as hard as you guys did in high school. And there’s always graduate school if you do really want to go to the States right?</p>\n",
      "<p>I hope the best for all of you guys and I’m praying for you guys even though I don’t know you guys personally. I pray for the best, but expect the worst. I pray that even if the worst happens, you guys will laugh it off and come out as a better person and don’t give up.</p>\n",

      "<p>Hi! As an international student that already passed though the stressful college application process, I want to say a couple of things. The OP made a HUGE mistake, or was misinformed, and thus applied to extremely selective college with international acceptance rates of lower than 10%. For other over achieving internationals, there are many other options, such as applying to lower ranked schools that offer both merit and need based aid. This is what students from my school, including me, do. I know many students who have gotten full rides at lower ranked schools, such as St Marys in Texas or Mercyhurst, with SATs around 1600-1800 but with good GPAs. A good student with a 2000+ SAT score is ALMOST guaranteed a scholarship at schools with around 1600-1800 average SAT scores. Also, to anyone wondering, there are only SIX need blind schools for internationals that DO NOT take into consideration your financial situation- Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, Amherst College, MIT. Any over achiever should apply to these schools, but also remembering that the acceptance rate for internationals is less than US citizens due to quotas.</p>\n",

      "The international student experience at top colleges can vary significantly based on a range of factors, including the institution's policies towards international students, financial aid availability, and the overall campus culture. Here are some key aspects of the international student experience at top colleges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Application Process**: As highlighted in the discussion, international students often face tougher admission standards. Top universities tend to have lower acceptance rates for international candidates compared to domestic students. Factors such as academic excellence (high GPA and test scores), unique extracurricular achievements, and demonstrated for financial support play critical roles in the application process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Financial Aid and Affordability**: A significant challenge for international students is securing financial aid. Many top universities in the U.S. do not offer substantial financial aid to international students. As discussed, schools like UCLA and UC Berkeley, which prioritize California residents, provide limited financial support. International students may often be required to demonstrate their ability to pay high tuition fees (e.g., $60,000+ per year), which can be a barrier to admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diversity and Perspectives**: International students bring diverse cultural perspectives to the campus environment, enriching the academic and social experience for all students. Many colleges actively promote diversity and inclusivity, with organizations and services dedicated to supporting international students.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Community and Support**: Once admitted, international students often find supportive communities on campus. Many universities have international student offices that help with visa issues, cultural adjustment, and networking. Student organizations focused on international students can provide a sense of belonging and friendship among peers facing similar challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cultural Adjustment**: Adapting to life in a new country can be challenging. International students may experience culture shock and homesickness, particularly in their initial months. However, many find that engaging with campus activities, clubs, and social events can help ease the transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Success Stories and Resilience**: Stories shared by international students often highlight their resilience. Despite numerous rejections from elite institutions, many find success and happiness at other universities. The experience can foster personal growth and collaboration among students from various backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Academic Rigor**: The academic environment in top U.S. colleges can be intense. International students may face unique challenges in adapting to different educational styles, but they often thrive in rigorous settings, contributing rich perspectives to discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the journey of applying to and attending top colleges as an international student can be challenging and competitive, the supportive communities and resources at these institutions can lead to transformative experiences. Commitments to mental health support and accommodating diverse student needs can also significantly enhance the overall experience.\n",
